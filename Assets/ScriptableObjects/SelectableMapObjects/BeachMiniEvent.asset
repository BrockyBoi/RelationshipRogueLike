  EventDescriptionText: With the sun beating down on a hot, Canada day you know today's
    the day to show off your hot beach bod.  Amrita is ready to go whenever you are,
    but you need to buy a new swimsuit.
  MinorMapEventResultChoices:
  - _resultIsToCloseUI: 0
    _choiceDescription: 1. Buy something revealing
    _potentialResults:
    - OutcomeDescription: You've been working out, haven't had a carb in 192 days,
        and it shows.  Amrita knows that everyone is going to be staring at you at
        the beach today, but she's more than happy to join in.  Even if you make
        some mistakes in the future, Amrita having this mental image of you will
        make her far more forgiving.

      PercentChanceForOutcome: 0.5
    - OutcomeDescription: You could only find something with muted colors, but you
        still look nice.  You two make a nice pair, and have a well deserved stress-free
        date.  Ahhh, young love.

        AdditiveValue: 2

      PercentChanceForOutcome: 0.75
    - OutcomeDescription: The only swimsuit they have left is a bikini seemingly
        held together with pieces of floss.  You buy it, but get self conscious last
        second and call off the date.  You tell Amrita you've come down with "minor
        Polio" and it's pretty clear that you're lying.  She won't be forgetting
        this any time soon.

  - _resultIsToCloseUI: 0
    _choiceDescription: 2. Buy something modest
    _potentialResults:
    - OutcomeDescription: You get a one-piece suit that isn't too flashy or revealing. 
        You know you could have gone a different route, but this swimsuit makes you
        feel fun and confident.  You have a great day at the beach and don't second
        guess yourself for a moment.

      - ModifierType: 3
        AdditiveValue: 0
        MultiplicativeValue: 0.8
      PercentChanceForOutcome: 0.9
    - OutcomeDescription: What if Amrita thinks I don't look good in a swimsuit? 
        What if I'm too pale?  What if I get sunburned and everyone points and laugh? 
        Anxiety swirls through your mind.  You panic at the last moment and buy an
        XL winter coat that goes well past your knees.  You look surprisngly cute
        at the beach, but still get heat stroke.

    _choiceDescription: 3. Fuck it, show up naked
    _potentialResults:
    - OutcomeDescription: Bad decision.  For so many reasons.  Why the hell would
        you choose that?  Did you think this would be a good outcome?  No. Of course
        not.  Idiot.  I don't even have a story written out for this.  Amrita is
        embarrased and leaves you.  There.  Lose 9 health points.
